<p>These are just some various javascript tools / toys I've made.  None of them do things that haven't been done by others plenty of times before, but I tend to dislike the way javascript tools work.  For one thing I like them to just calculate as you enter the date rather than have to hit a calculate button.  I haven't spent any time on style other than making them usable.</p>
